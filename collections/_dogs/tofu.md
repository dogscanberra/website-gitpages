Hey there! My name's Tofu and I am a kind, caring, and polite Labrador cross. 

As an active and energetic boy my favourite things to do are tug-of-war and fetch, preferably at the same time! I also love going to events, where I can bring smiles to peoples faces, especially if there's food involved! 

I've recently joined Dogs Canberra's walking program to help spread joy in the local community. 
I'll see you at the park!
