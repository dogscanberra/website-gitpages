Hi, I’m Willow! I’m a Kelpie x Cattle Dog mix bursting with energy and always ready to join in on the fun. Whether it’s a walk, a game, or a cuddle, I love being part of the action.

I enjoy rough-and-tumble play and do best with people or dogs who can match my energy. I’ve got a good start on my training—solid recall, good manners, and I usually walk nicely on lead (unless something exciting catches my nose!).

I’m looking for an active home that understands working breeds. I thrive with structure, clear boundaries, and lots of interaction. After a busy day, I settle easily and sleep soundly. If you’re after a playful, loyal companion, I could be the one!
