        <h2 class="page-subtitle">General Enquiries</h2>
        For most enquiries, we have two email addresses that are best to use.
        <ul>
            <li class="pt10"><a href="mailto:info@dogscbr.org" class="fas fa-envelope no-hyperlink"> info@dogscbr.org</a><br>
                If you're looking to get in touch with us for media, collaborations or similar, this is probably the best way to do so!  This is a monitored inbox where you can reach out to initiate communications.
            <li class="pt10"><a href="mailto:general@dogscbr.org" class="fas fa-envelope no-hyperlink"> general@dogscbr.org</a><br>
                If you're a stakeholder or member with us, you'll probably hear from us mostly here.  It's how we distribute information to our members or keep up regular communications with collaborating stakeholders.
        </ul>
