<h2 class="page-subtitle">Our Ambassador</h2>
<p>
  We're thrilled to introduce you to Nymeria. Nymeria couldn't be a more perfect
  DogsCBR ambassador to spread positivity and joy!
  <br /><br />
  We’re incredibly lucky to have her, and over the course of 2024-5, you might
  spot Nymeria around the local hospitals, libraries, and schools, spreading
  joy. While she won't reside with us once our shelter is established, you'll
  still find her around, eagerly seeking pats.
  <br /><br />
  Nymeria is a Border Collie with a tummy-rub addiction, and an incredible
  enthusiasm for greeting every person and dog she encounters. She shares her
  home with four beloved cat siblings whom she adores.
