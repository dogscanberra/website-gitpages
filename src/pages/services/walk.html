      What is our Community Walking Program?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our Community Walking Program is a service which allows people from all walks of life to spend time with a canine companion. 
      You can go for a walk, play a game of fetch, or just spend some time socialising with one of our furry friends. Walking a dog 
      is good for you, the dog, and the community!

      Why Walk a Dog?
    </h2>
    <p>
      <u>It's Good for You!</u>
      <br>
      Walking a dog can help you to feel refreshed and revitalised, and promotes both physical and mental health. The non-judgmental 
      presence of a dog can provide a deep sense of companionship and emotional support. 
      <br><br>
      <u>It's Good for the Dog!</u>
      <br>
      Our dogs will benefit greatly from socialisation and exercise. By spending time with a range of people our dogs will learn more 
      about the world around them, helping to prepare them for adoption. 
      <br><br>
      <u>It's Good for the Community!</u>
      <br>
      When you walk the dogs in our Community Walking Program, you are supporting our foster carers with the great work they do. Getting 
      out and about also brings awareness to our mission and promotes wellbeing throughout the community.
