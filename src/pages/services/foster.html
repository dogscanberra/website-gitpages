      What Is Fostering?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Fostering is providing a temporary home for a dog in need, giving them a safe and supportive environment to heal, 
        grow, and adjust to life in a home. It plays a vital role in preparing dogs for adoption by helping them build 
        confidence, learn routines, and develop trust. Foster care increases a dog’s chances of finding a forever home 
        by giving them the stability and love they need to thrive.

      Why Foster With Dogs Canberra?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fostering with Dogs Canberra means fostering with the support of your community. We believe that it takes a 
      village to raise a child (or in this case a dog!) which is why we’re committed to giving all the assistance we can.
      <br><br>
      <u>Assistance</u>
      <br>
        We understand that the cost of fostering a dog can be weighty, but we are here to help! Dogs Canberra provides 
        all the essentials (lead, harness, water/food bowls, beds) to help foster carers get their homes ready for the 
        dogs. We provide food and treats for the first two weeks, and cover medical costs for pre-existing and long-term 
        treatment.      
      <br><br>
      <u>Training</u>
      <br>
        We want to make sure our dogs have the best chance at rehabilitation. A key part of any dog’s journey to a forever 
        home is training. We work with dog trainers based in Canberra to provide training opportunities for dogs being 
        adopted. Training focuses on building the skills they will need to thrive in their community.
      <br><br>
      <u>Support</u>
      <br>
        Fostering a dog can be time-consuming, which is why Dogs Canberra has a village to help. From dog walkers getting 
        dogs out and into the community, to trainers teaching you how to care for your dog, there will always be 
        someone to help foster carers in their new venture.

      How Do I Become a Foster Carer?
    </h2>
    <p>
      To become a foster carer you will need to complete the Foster section of our Foster and Adopt Expression of Interest 
      form. From there we will reach out for a meet-and-greet and house inspection to ensure you and your household are dog-ready.
      <br><br>
      Since all dogs have different needs, we aim to match our foster carers with foster dogs that fit their lifestyles. When we 
      find a dog we think will be a good match for you, we’ll reach out for a meet-and-greet with that dog and begin the fostering 
      process!
