      Why Adopt With Dogs Canberra?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Rescue shelters across the ACT and NSW are overflowing with dogs that need loving homes. By adopting one of our dogs, you 
      can free up much needed space and save lives.
      <br><br>
      At Dogs Canberra we take care to ensure our dogs find the best possible home by looking for genuine connections between adopter 
      and dog. This helps to ensure the best experience for dog and human alike, whilst reducing the rate of returns.

      How Do I Adopt One of Your Dogs?
    </h2>
    <p>
      To adopt with us you will need to complete the Adopt section of our Foster and Adopt Expression of Interest form. Let us 
      know which dog you are interested in adopting. From there we will reach out for a meet-and-greet with the dog and house 
      inspection to ensure you and your household are dog-ready.

      Kingsley
    </h2>

    <p>
      <br>
      Kingsley was originally surrendered to us in March 2025, through Campbelltown Animal Care Facility. When he arrived at our door step, 
      Kingsley had mild anxiety, was slightly overweight, and was quite the persistent barker.
      <br><br>
      Through our training stream and with the help of our incredible trainer Chris Woodgate (from <a href="https://aintmisbehavin.com.au/" target="_blank">Ain’t Misbehavin’ Dog Training</a>), we focused on his diet, his barking, and - just as importantly - his mental wellbeing and stimulation. 
      Over time, and with the support of several amazing foster carers, Kingsley began to open up to both humans and dogs. And he flourished.
      <br><br>
      He proved himself to be incredibly smart, affectionate, and full of personality. His resilience, especially through multiple foster 
      transitions, was remarkable - each time, showing how ready he was to love and adapt again. He even became a bit of a local star, joining 
      us at community events and making his radio debut!
      <br><br>
      Kingsley’s adoption journey saw an amazing response, and we’re so grateful to every single person who reached out, especially those who 
      travelled long ways just to meet him. In the end, Brent and Nicole, who also share their home with his littermate Artemis, made the 
      journey from Melbourne to Canberra 3 times to meet him. Their dedication spoke volumes and it was a joy to get to know our Brent and 
      Nicole (not just as adopters, but as people), and we know Kingsley will be much loved.
