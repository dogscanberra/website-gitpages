    <p>
      Dogs Canberra proudly supports Australian veterans by facilitating
      meaningful, therapeutic interactions with dogs, enhancing mental health,
      reducing isolation, and fostering community engagement. Drawing from our
      extensive experience in canine welfare and community outreach, our program
      aims to provide veterans across Canberra with accessible, non-clinical
      support through carefully structured interactions with dogs.

      <p>
        We aim to collaborate with RSL Clubs, service clubs, support groups, and
        community organisations to host dedicated veteran-focused events. These
        gatherings offer a safe environment for veterans to meet our dogs,
        engage with peers, and access support networks.

      <h2 class="box-heading">Dog Foster, Ownership, and Adoption Support</h2>
      <p>
        Through extensive foster support - including covering set up costs,
        logistics, basic training, initial food costs, and medical treatment in
        line with our policies - we ensure dogs are matched with veteran
        adopters or foster carers, giving program participants a chance to
        foster or adopt without the initial financial and resource stressors. We
        hope to support our veterans so that they can find their perfect
        lifelong companion and best friend.

        We actively assist veterans interested in pursuing service dog
        companionship. Dogs Canberra can facilitate initial starting processes
        and, in eligible circumstances, partially or fully sponsor specialised
        service dog training.
