      <br>
      Dogs Canberra proudly supports Australian veterans by facilitating meaningful, therapeutic interactions with dogs, enhancing mental health, reducing isolation, and fostering community engagement.

Drawing from our extensive experience in canine welfare and community outreach, our program aims to provide veterans across Canberra with accessible, non-clinical support through carefully structured interactions with dogs.

    <p>
    Dogs Canberra defines a veteran in line with the Department of Veteransâ€™ Affairs (DVA):

      Our Services
    </h2>
    <p>
      <u>Community Engagement and Events</u>
      <br>
      We aim to collaborate with RSL Clubs, service clubs, support groups, and community organisations to host dedicated veteran-focused events. These gatherings offer a safe environment for veterans to meet our dogs, engage with peers, and access support networks.      
      <br><br>
      <u>Dog Foster, Ownership, and Adoption Support</u>
      <br>
        Through extensive foster support - including covering set up costs, logistics, basic training, initial food costs, and medical treatment in line with our policies - we ensure dogs are matched with veteran adopters or foster carers, giving program participants a chance to foster or adopt without the initial financial and resource stressors. We hope to support our veterans so that they can find their perfect lifelong companion and best friend. 

      <br><br>
      <u>Service Dog Sponsorship and Facilitation</u>
      <br>
        We actively assist veterans interested in pursuing service dog companionship. Dogs Canberra can facilitate initial starting processes and, in eligible circumstances, partially or fully sponsor specialised service dog training.
